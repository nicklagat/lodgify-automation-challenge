I apologize for the oversight. Here's the updated README file with the missing test suites:

# Lodgify Automation QA Challenge

This repository contains end-to-end tests for a Todoist application. The tests are written using the Cypress testing framework and validate the functionality of various API endpoints and user interface.

# Assumptions:

I did assumptions that the user will be able to perform project creation, task creation, updating a task and deleting a project

## Overview

These tests are designed to cover various aspects of the Todoist application, including user authentication, project creation, task creation, updating tasks, and completing tasks as per the scenario requirements provided and the ones I generated. The aim is to ensure that the API and UI is functioning correctly and meets the specified requirements.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you on how to prepare your system for running the tests. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 10 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js installation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nicklagat/lodgify-automation-challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd lodgify-automation-challenge
   ```

3. Install dependencies (including Cypress):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the tests

Once you've installed Cypress and all of the project dependencies, you're ready to run the tests. Follow these instructions:

1. To open the Cypress Test Runner, use the command:
   ```
   npx cypress open
   ```
   or

2. To run the tests in headless mode, use the command:
   ```
   npx run test 

   ```

3. In the Cypress test runner window that opens, you will see a list of test files. Click on the test file you want to run. Cypress will run the tests and display the results in the Test Runner.

## Scenarios

Here's a detailed description of each test suite in our test framework:

### 1. Authentication via API

This suite contains the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1: Successful Authentication via API

This test case verifies that a user can authenticate via API and generate an access token. The steps of this test case are:

- Login via API and generate a token using valid credentials.
- Verify that the authToken exists in the Cypress environment variables.
- Verify that the authToken is not empty.
- Verify that the length of the authToken falls within the expected range (20-50 characters).
- Verify that the authToken matches the expected pattern (only contains alphanumeric characters).

#### Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Authentication via API with Incorrect Credentials

This test case verifies that a user cannot authenticate via API using incorrect credentials. The steps of this test case are:

- Attempt to login via API using incorrect credentials.
- Verify that the response status code is not 200 (indicating an unsuccessful authentication attempt).
- Verify that the response body does not contain a token (as the authentication attempt was unsuccessful).

### 2. Create Project

This suite contains the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1: Successful Project Creation via API

This test case verifies that a project can be created via API. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Create a new project via API.
- Log in to the web application.
- Verify that the project was created by visiting its URL on the web application.
- Assert that the project name is visible on the page.
- Assert that the current URL includes the project's ID.


#### Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Project Creation without Required Fields

This test case verifies that a project cannot be

 created via API without providing the required fields. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Attempt to create a new project without providing any required fields.
- Verify that the API returns an error response indicating the missing information.
- Check the API response to ensure it contains the correct error message.

### 3. Create Task Via API

This suite contains the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1: Successful Task Creation via API

This test case verifies that a task can be created within a project via API. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Create a new task within an existing project via API.
- Log in to the web application.
- Verify that the task was created by visiting its URL on the web application.
- Assert that the task description is visible on the page.
- Assert that the current URL includes the task's ID.


#### Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Task Creation without Required Fields

This test case verifies that a task cannot be created within a project via API without providing the required fields. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Attempt to create a new task within an existing project without providing any required fields.
- Verify that the API returns an error response indicating the missing information.
- Check the API response to ensure it contains the correct error message.

### 4. Update Task Via API

This suite contains the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1: Successful Task Update via API

This test case verifies that a task can be successfully updated via API. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Update the due date of a task via API.
- Log in to the web application.
- Verify that the updated due date is reflected on the task page.

#### Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Task Update without Providing Information

This test case verifies that a task cannot be updated via API without providing the necessary information. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Attempt to update a task via API without providing the new due date.
- Verify that the API response indicates a null due date.

### 5. Complete Task Via API

This suite contains the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1: Successful Task Completion via API

This test case verifies that a task can be successfully marked as complete via API. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Complete a task via API.
- Log in to the web application.
- Verify on the web application that the task has been marked as complete.

#### Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Task Completion without Providing Necessary Information

This test case verifies that a task cannot be marked as complete via API without providing the necessary information. The steps of this test case are:

- Authenticate or obtain the auth token.
- Attempt to mark a task as complete via API without providing a task ID.
- Verify that the API response indicates an unsuccessful completion attempt.



### 6. Validate Create Task via web application

This suite contains the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1: Successful Task creation via web application

The steps of this test case are:

1. Log into the web application.
2. Navigate to the specific project.
3. Create a new task via the web application.
4. Verify on the web application that the task has been created.


### 7. Validate Update Task via web application

This suite contains the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1: Successful Task updation via web application

The steps of this test case are:

1. Log into the web application.
2. Navigate to the specific task.
3. Update the task via the web application.
4. Save the changes.
5. Verify on the api that the task has been updated.
